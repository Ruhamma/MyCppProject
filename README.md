# MyCppProject

## Project Description
**MyCppProject** is a simple C++ project that demonstrates basic programming concepts and software configuration management (SCM) practices. The project includes functions for mathematical operations and string manipulations, organized in a modular structure using header and source files. It also showcases the use of Git for version control, branching, and collaboration.

---

## Project Structure
```
MyCppProject/
├── src/              # Source files for the project
├── include/          # Header files for declarations
├── Makefile          # Build automation file
└── .gitignore        # Files to be ignored by Git
```

## Build and Run Instructions
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) and `make` installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or navigate to the project directory.
3. Open a terminal in the project root directory (`MyCppProject`).
4. Run the following command to build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```
5. After a successful build, run the executable:
   ```
   ./MyCppProject
   ```

## Implemented Functions

### Math Functions
- **`add(int a, int b)`**: Adds two integers and returns the result.
- **`subtract(int a, int b)`**: Subtracts the second integer from the first and returns the result.

### String Functions
- **`concatenate(const std::string& str1, const std::string& str2)`**: Concatenates two strings and returns the result.
- **`stringLength(const std::string& str)`**: Returns the length of the given string.
- **`reverseString(const std::string& str)`**: Reverses the given string and returns the result.

---

## Example Output
When you run the program, it will display output similar to this:
```
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Concatenation: Hello, World!
String Length: 7
Original: Hello, World!
Reversed: !dlroW ,olleH
```
